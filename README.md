# Dungeon Master Server

This repository contains a server that acts as a Dungeon Master (DM) for Dungeons & Dragons (DND) games. Users send requests to the server, and the server responds as the DM, guiding adventures, narrating events, and handling game logic.

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dungeon-master-server.git
   cd dungeon-master-server
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies with uv:**
   - Make sure `uv` is installed on your system.
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```
     uv venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     uv sync
     ```

3. **Interact with the server:**
   - Send DND requests through your chosen interface (e.g., HTTP, CLI, etc.).
   - The server will respond as the Dungeon Master.
